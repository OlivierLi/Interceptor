Interceptor
============

A simple game implemented using c++ and OpenGL. This is still in the verly early stages and almost nothing is done.

The gameplay will be simplistic as this is a learning project.

This is a learning experience so all rendering is done by hand WITHOUT the use of SF::Graphics.
